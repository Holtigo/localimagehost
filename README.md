<h2>What is it?</h2>
<p>I'm experimenting with hosting a webserver on a raspberry 
pi-like computer. I want a more convenient way of looking 
at my locally store photos from over the years. Instead of 
scowering through folders, it would be more fun to see them 
all on a webpage.</p>

<p>I'm trying to emulate the style of Google Photos, as I like 
their design a lot.</p>
